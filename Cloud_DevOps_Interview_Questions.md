# Cloud DevOps Engineer/Architect Interview Questions & Answers

### Web Technologies
What happens when type google.com in browser and enter ?
<details>
<summary></summary>

  * **type g**		
  	* Browser Auto Complete function from history, bookmarks, cookies, cache and popular searches kicks in 
  * **press enter**	
  	* char converted to int 13, signal will be sent to hardware microprocessor
  * **parse URL**			
      * it forms Uniform Resource Locator i.e. protocol-http and resource "/"
  * **URL or Search**		
    - uses default search engine if its URL or search term ?
  * **Convert non-ASCII chars in hostname** 
    * convert URL hostname chars from a-z,A-Z,0-9,-,. to ASCII encoding
  * **HSTS Check**			
    * browser checks preloded HTTP Strict Trasnport Security policy ?
    * HTTPS instead of HTTP.
  * **DNS Lookup**
    - verify DNS name from browser cache
    - check local machine host file mapping for DNS lookup
    - if not local router or DNS server
    - Address Resolution(ARP) process for default Gateway IP
  * **Address Resolution Protocol**
    - Check local ARP Cache for target IP
    - if not, any subnets target IP in the local route table
    - if not use default gateway subnet
    - grab local MAC address, look for target MAC Address
    - sends L2 (Data link)	
    - broadcast the ARP request to all other ports and wait for reply
    - if any switch, the re-broadcast the ARP request to all other ports
    - ARP reply is received, now we know DNS server IP
    - DNS client(source port 1023) establish socket UDP port 53 on DNS Server 
  * **Opening of Socket**
    - Once target IP of destination server is received
    - https(443) or http(80 default)
    - request L4 TCP socket stream to target IP
      - destination port 
      - source port added to header
    - request sent to L3(Network layer), 
      - adds targetIP & current IP in header
    - request will be sent to L2 (DataLink)
      - add MAC address of gateway
    - Physical layers converts to binary
    - vi ISP hits target server - TPC Conn FLOW
      - Client choose ISN & sends SYN packet to server 
      - Server adds ISN+1, ACK sends to Client
      - Client sends ACK,ISN+1, receiver ack number
      - Data Transfers, sends ACK
      - closer sends FIN packet
      - otherside ACK
  * **TLS Handshake**
    - Client sends TLS ClientHello, cipher algo & compression method
    - Server sends TLS ServerHello + public CA
      - client verifies CA against trusted CA's,
      - generates pseudo random bytes ( symmetric key)
    - Encrypt with Server Public key 
    - Server decrypt using Private key & makes own copy of symmetric master key
    - Client sends Finished message with symetric key
    - Server generetes hash, decrypts with client sent hash(symmetric key) to verify it matches
    - Server sends its own Finished message to the client, also encrypted with the symmetric key
    - TLS session transmits with symmetric key
  * **HTTP Protocol**
    - http reqeust will be sent
    - from server 200 ok response headers
    - sent payload of html
    - browser parses(image, css etc)
  * **HTTP Server Request Handle**
    - HTTPD break downs GET, POST, HEAD,PUT, PAtH, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS
    - rewrite modules
    - headers handlers etc
  * **Browser**
    - HTML Parsinig
    - CSS interpretation
    - Page Rendering
    - GPU Rendering
    - Browser add-ons

### Networking
* **Explain 3 Way TCP Handshake?**
  * First step is 3-way handshake must be established
  * **1st Step**: 
    * Client sends SYN segment to the server 
    * ISN(InitialSeqNum)=7001, ACK=0, SYN=1)  
    * source port: client ephemeral port
    * destination port: 443
  * **2nd Step2**: 
    * Server replies SYN + ACK to client & ask for Open
    * SYN=1, ACK=1, ACK Number=7002, Server Seq #3001  
    * source port: 443
    * destination port: client ephemeral port
  * **3rd Step**: 
    * SYN-0, ACK=1, ACK number=3002, Initial Seq=7002
    * source port: client ephemeral port
    * destination port: 443

  * A file that digitally ties a cryptographic key to an organizations details. 
  * This is not the same as a SSL or TLS certificate, but it is interchangeable all the time.

* **How Https works?**</br>
  * Browser sends www.youtube.com
  * Server sends public key (signed by google CA)
  * Browser Trust & verifies google CA public key
  * Browser sends new secret, encrypt with google public key 
  * Server can decrypt with server's private key. now all set
  * Now both server & client encrypt and communicate each other [ref](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/HTTPS-message-sequence-diagram-with-detailed-TLS-handshaking-steps_fig1_306187575)</br>

* **What is CA Certificate? How www.youtube.com gets Certificate?**
  * Issuer: Google CA has its own Public key & Private key
  * Youtube Web Server: Has own Public key & Private key
  * youtbue will send Certificate Signing request (with key pair) & ask Google CA to sign in
  * Google CA will signs with their private key
  * when browsers connects youtube.com, its verifies youtube's public key and rue and trusted
* **What is Self Signed Certificate?**
  * App1 create one pair (Public key & Private key)
  * create key pair for our own CA
  * send CSR
  * Approve & Sign
  * If App2 try to connect App1, it wont trust

* **What are the Network Topology Types** ?
  * Point to Point
  * Bus
  * Ring
  * Star
  * Tree
  * Mesh
  * Hybrid
* **Explain Network delivery steams**?
  * **Unitcast**: One to one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.

  * **Broadcast**: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting. Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.

  * **Multicast**: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.
 
### Linux
* **How SSH Configuration**
	- server configured with public key & `sshd service` running
	- client will verify server in network `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
	- negotiate with shared session key
	- client sends ID of the key pair
	- server checks the `authorized_keys` file
	- server generate random num with public key and sends msgs
	- client decrypt msg get random num
	- client combine random num + session key sends MD5 hash
	- server uses same shared session key

* **How SSH Works ?**</br>
  <img src="https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/images/ssh-key-based-authentication.png" title="SSH authentication process flow" alt="ssh key authentication work flow" style="max-width: 60%"></br>
  <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4cZbh.png" alt="enter image description here">
* **Explain private & public key role in ssh** 
	- private key stores at client
	- public key will be at server
* **Linux command to check the logs**
  	```sh
	tail -f /var/log/mail.log
	```
	
* **how to find system slow, EFS slow**
   	```sh
	yum install -y nfs-utils
	nfsstat -s	#at NFS server, check badcalls >0
	nfsstat -c	#at NFS client
	nfsiostat 	#at NFS client check its performance avg RTT(ms) and retrans
	```
* **how to run shell script in background**

  	```sh
	cat /proc/cpuinfo 
  	lscpu
  	service --status-all
  	chkconfig --list
  	uptime
	```
	- Step 1: Check I/O wait and CPU Idletime using `top`
		- `wa (I/O wait)`
		- `id (CPU idletime)`
	- Step 2: IO Wait is low and idle time is low: check CPU user time
		- `%us`
	- Step 3: IO wait is low and idle time is high
		- slowness isn't due to CPU or IO problems, it's likely an app-specific issue
		- `starce or lsof`
	- Step 4: IO Wait is high: check your swap usage
		- `top or free -m`
	- Step 5: swap usage is high 
		- means out of RAM
	- Step 6: swap usage is low
		- means real IO wait 
		- use `iotop`
	- Step 7: Check memory usage

  * with less, can go start and end of file 
  * less is better for large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.  
* **Why Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Protocol is used**?
  * ICMP used to communicate problems in network
communicate problems with data transmission
  * eco request and eco reply
  * Firewall rules for ICMP (TCP/UDP port 7)

### DevOps
* **DevOps Deployment strategies?**
  * **Recreate**: Version A is terminated then version B is rolled out.
  * **Rolling-update/incremental**: Version B is slowly rolled out and replacing version A.
  * **Blue/Green**: Version B is released alongside version A, then the traffic is switched to version B.
  * **Canary**: Version B is released to a subset of users, then proceed to a full rollout.
  * **A/B testing**: Version B is released to a subset of users under specific condition.
  * **Shadow**: Version B receives real-world traffic alongside version A and doesnâ€™t impact the response.

	- git reset --hard <commit>
* Diff between git merge and git rebase
	- merge combines source branch to a target branch, preserves the entire history
	- rebase overwrites the changes
	
* Diff between git pull vs git fetch
	- git fetch retrieve the latest meta-data from original
	- git pull brings the changes from remote & adds in local but not commit
* git clone specific branch
  	- git clone -b brnachname
* git stash
 	- temparary save
* git how to revert specific branch 
	- git log             	(Shows the commit logs)
	- git revert commitID         (directly commits/reverts )
	- git revert -n commitID      (merges the changes but not commit)
	- git reset  --hard commitID  (resets & reverts the changes)
	
* git differnece
	- git diff	(Shows the changes between unstaged files and the commits)
	- git diff --staged	(Shows the changes between staged(ready-to-be-committed) files and the commits)

* git find list of commited files
	- git log --oneline

### Docker
* **What is default docker network applies when creating containers**
	- default bridge network are usually used when your apps run in standalone containers that need to communicate]
* **Explain Container Network Model?**
  * Network Controller - Provides the entry point into libnetwork
  * Driver - Provides actual implementation that makes n/w work
  * Network - Is an implementation of CNM: Network
  * End Point - Provides the connectivity for services exposed by container in n/w
  * Sandbox - represent container's n/w configuration (IPaddr,MacAddr,routes,dns etc)
* **Docker Network Drivers** ?
  * **Bridge** - default n/w driver to communicate sandalone containers
  * **Host** - uses host networking directly, cannot run same containers on same port
  * **None** - disables n/w for containers
  * **Overlay** - connects multiple docker daemons together and enable docker daemons to communicate each other
  * **Mcvlan** - allows to assign MacAddress so that it will appear as physical device. useful for legacy apps 
  * **IPvlan** - total control over both IPv4 and IPv6, network integration of IPvlan L2 & L3
  * **none** - 
* **How docker resolves the container names ?**
  * docker has builtin dns server in Sandbox which help containers to resolve IP using its name
  * docker creates network namespaces to isloate
* What is docker compose ?
  * utility to define multiple containers as YAML in declarative way
* Diff between docker CMD and ENTRYPOINT ?
  * CMD defines default commands and/or parameters for a container
  * ENTRYPOINT is preferred when you want to define a container with a specific executable
  * Combine ENTRYPOINT with CMD if you need a container with a specified executable and a default parameter that can be modified easily
* How can we make docker image lightweight ?
  * using multi stage builds
* How docker builds images?
  * using layers, layers 1 base image, layer 2 run app packages, layer 3 copy files...
  * docker re-use layers from cache
* How many types of docker volume mounts?
  * volume mounting - mount from volume location 
    * docker run --mount type=volume, source=/var/lib/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql
  * bind mounting - mount from any location - /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql 
    * docker run --mount type=bind, source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql

### Kubernetes
* Explain kubernetes architecture ?
* If i give 3 servers, how you setup kubernetes ?
* kubernetes diff components ?
  - master, controller, scheduler, ETCD, flannel & caliko
  - node, container run time, kubelet, kubeproxy
* What are the taints & tolerations ?
	- Taint will be applied to nodes as key value paid, will allow to force set of pods
	- Tolerations will be applied to pods, allow the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.
* Assigning Pods to Nodes - Node Affinity
	- nodeSelector is a field of PodSpec 
	- Node affinity (under pod spec) is similar to nodeSelector but more expressive syntax
	   	- requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution. it allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node
* How you acheive pod security
	- use securityContext in pods runAsUser, runAsGroup, runAsNonRoot & fsGroup
	- use securityContext => linux capabilities
* Explain about Stateful sets
	- like deployment but maintains a sticky identity for each Pods, not interchangeable & persistent identifier 
	- must need pv, headless service
	- Stable, unique network identifiers
	- Stable, persistent storage
	- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
	- Ordered, Automated rolling updates
* Headless service
	- used for Statefiul set pod
	- No Load balancing, directly interact with Pod
	- service discovery with service name
* What is Init container
	- Specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod
	- used for setup scripts
* Diff between deployment, service and daemonset
	- Deployments manage stateless services
	- DaemonSets attempt to adhere to a one-Pod-per-node model
	- Service is an abstract way to expose an app running on a set of Pods as a network service
* Explain kubernetes reverse proxy
	- Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster
	- Ingress maps service
	- http path based
